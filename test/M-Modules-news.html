            <h2 class="h2">SmartWeb UI Official release (1.0.0)</h2>

            <p><small>Posted January 23, 2014 by <strong>Michael Rachlitz</strong>. Filed under Releases.</small></p>

            <p>After six weeks, SmartWeb UI has now been downloaded more than 2000 times.</p>

            <p>Version 1.0.0 is the first official release. 1.0.0 includes an official grid built with SUSY, flexible and ready to adjust as necessary. SmartWeb UI is built with the priciple of mobile-first, however the UI also contains helper classes to lock the grid at breakpoints.</p>

            <p>It also contains a fix for embedding tweets (by placing the URL to the tweet on its own line), which was broken due to a recent Twitter API change. (For more on Embeds, see the Codex.)</p>

            <p>For a full list of changes, consult the list of tickets and the changelog. There’s also a detailed summary for developers on the development blog.</p>

            <p>If you are one of the thousands already running SmartWeb, we will have developed a new exiting UI package as well as many new templates.</p>

            <p><a href="...">Download SmartWeb UI 1.0.0</a> or venture over to <a href="...">smartweb.dk/demo</a> to accuire your very own demo of SmartWeb with SmartWeb UI included.</p>

            <p>Thanks to these fine individuals for contributing to 1.0.0:</p>
