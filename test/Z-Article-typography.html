        <p>We've seen some great gadgets and equipment for designers. So many cool stuff, that we could actually assemble infinite perfect office spaces! Every week we'll assemble a perfect office, and we'd like you to help us. What equipment would the perfect office have?</p>

        <p>Conceal your top secret messages from nosey strangers by writing with these blacklight markers. Under regular light the ink from the marker remains invisible – but when it’s placed under UV black lights, they visibly come to life. (at <a href="#">This is Why I'm Broke</a>)</p>

        <h2>Edison LED light bulbs</h2>

        <p>Add a touch of turn-of-the-century class to your space without needing turn-of-the-century technology with these Edison LED Light Bulbs. Thanks to warm color temps, each of the three bulbs — they're available in traditional round, teardrop, and G95 shapes — gives off all the atmosphere and ambiance of a real Edison-era bulb while using a smidgen of the power, making them a terrific blend of old and new.

        <h3>Corkboard map</h3>

        <p>Picturize the world from your eyes of travel through this marvellous 16 piece self-adhesive Corkboard Map. It’s a world map fashioned out of cork which sticks efficiently on the wall and serves as an enchanting way of highlighting all those trips you made around the planet. By allowing the usage of push pins, the map makes attaching pictures and travel itineraries super easy and hassle-free. The set comes in a naturally designed card box which makes the piece worth an ideal gift for your traveller friend out there. Make the world your personalized planet by incorporating this cork style of remembering places. (at <a href="#">The Gadget Flow</a>)</p>

        <h4>Cobra jumpjacket</h4>

        <p>The Cobra Electronics CPP 7500 JumPack by Cobra Electronics does that. But it also packs enough juice to actually jump start your car as well. Churning out a massive 200Amp starting current, it can deliver up to 400Amp at peak, which is enough to get most dead car batteries up and running in no time. It also comes with a 2.1 Amp USB Port for rapid charging of portable devices. Built-in LED flashlight - super-bright work, strobe and S.O.S. emergency LED light. (at <a href="#">Like Cool</a>)</p>

        <h4>Switch wireless charger</h4>

        <p>If you've jumped aboard the wireless charging bandwagon, you probably know that most wireless charging stations are flat, squarish surfaces not conducive to actually using your phone. The Swich Wireless Charger is different. Offering support for the Qi charging standard, it features a microsuction charging platform with a viewer-friendly angle that can rotate from vertical to horizontal, allowing you to switch the orientation on your phone. In addition, it boasts a ceramic base and platform, with a piece of American walnut cut to resemble the shape of a wave in the middle, making it something you'll be proud to have on your desk.

        <h5>Qwertywriters</h5>

        <p>There’s a good chance you’ve heard of the word “steampunk” by this point. It’s a blending of Victorian aesthetics and mannerisms with modern or advanced technology. Really old-fashioned Sci-Fi if you will. While it keeps cropping up in music videos, television, and all over the Internet, it is truly a way of life for some. It has inspired a lot of amazing contraptions that are not only functional, but look beautiful to boot! Brian Min, a game developer who has a passion for mechanical keyboards was inspired by typewriters of a bygone era, and decided to combine the two. He came up with the Qwertywriter. This is an 84-key USB keyboard that uses Cherry MX Blue switches underneath a vintage-themed key cap. There is a move-able return bar, but at the present it doesn’t have any functionality. This is Bluetooth enabled, but you can plug it in via USB. (at <a href="#">Coolest Gadgets</a>)</p>
